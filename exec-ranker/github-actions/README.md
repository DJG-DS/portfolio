## 🔁 GitHub Actions

Runs daily at 6 AM UTC. Trains the model and logs Precision@5 to `logs/precision_log.csv`. Uploads model as artifact.

You can also trigger manually via the Actions tab.

## 🚀 FastAPI Prediction

Start the server:

```bash
uvicorn github-actions.predict:app --reload
```

Then send a POST request to:
