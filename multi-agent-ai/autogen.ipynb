    "# Setting Up and Running Autogen Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Autogen Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "Autogen Studio is a powerful tool designed to simplify the creation and management of AI-driven agents. These agents can automate tasks, interact with users, or perform various operations based on predefined instructions or AI models like GPT. Autogen Studio provides an intuitive user interface that allows you to design, test, and deploy these agents with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to set up Autogen Studio in your development environment and get it running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. This guide assumes you are using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Setup Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create a New Project Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new folder where you want to store your project files.\n",
    "2. Open this folder in your IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the terminal in your IDE.\n",
    "2. Create a virtual environment by typing the following command:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python -m venv .venv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Activate the virtual environment:\n",

    "\n",
    "- To keep your terminal clean, you can clear the screen:\n",
    "    - On Windows:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      cls\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - On macOS/Linux:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      clear\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Set Your OpenAI API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visit the OpenAI API Keys page: [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).\n",
    "2. Create a new secret key.\n",
    "3. Set the API key in your terminal:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    set OPEN_API_KEY=\"your-secret-key\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   Replace `your-secret-key` with the actual key you generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Start Autogen Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start the Autogen Studio UI by typing the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    autogenstudio ui\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The terminal will display a message similar to:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8081\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Hold `CTRL` and click on the provided address (`http://127.0.0.1:8081`). This will open the Autogen Studio UI in your default web browser."

    "# Autogen Studio UI Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Autogen Studio is a powerful platform designed to streamline the creation and management of automated workflows using AI-driven tools. The interface is user-friendly, making it accessible for both beginners and advanced users. The UI is divided into two main sections: **Build** and **Playground**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build Section\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Build** section is where you design, configure, and manage the components that drive your automated processes. It is divided into four main subsections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Skills\n",
    "In the **Skills** section, you define the specific abilities your AI models will use. Skills can range from natural language processing to data manipulation, and they are the building blocks for your workflows. Here, you can create, edit, and manage these skills, tailoring them to suit the needs of your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Models\n",
    "The **Models** section is where you select and configure the AI models that power your skills. Autogen Studio supports a variety of models, allowing you to choose the most appropriate one based on your task requirements. You can also manage model versions, update configurations, and monitor performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Agents\n",
    "In the **Agents** section, you design and manage the agents that will execute tasks using the skills and models you've set up. Agents are essentially the active entities that perform actions based on the input they receive. You can customize their behavior, set triggers, and define how they interact with other agents or external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Workflows\n",
    "The **Workflows** section ties everything together. Here, you create automated processes by linking skills, models, and agents into cohesive workflows. Workflows are visualized as flowcharts, making it easy to understand the sequence of operations. You can drag and drop components, set conditions, and define branching logic to create complex automation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Playground Section\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Playground** section is your testing ground. Once you've built your workflows, you can simulate them in the Playground to see how they perform in real-time. This section allows you to tweak parameters, observe outputs, and make adjustments before deploying your workflows in a live environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define Your Skills\n",
    "Start by navigating to the **Skills** section in the Build tab. Here, you'll define the core capabilities your agents will need. For example, if you're building a chatbot, you might create skills for understanding user queries, retrieving information, and generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Choose and Configure Models\n",
    "Next, move to the **Models** section. Select an appropriate model for each skill you've defined. Configure the models according to your specific needs, adjusting parameters such as input data types, output formats, and processing speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Design Your Agents\n",
    "In the **Agents** section, create agents that will use the skills and models you've set up. Define their roles, set triggers for when they should act, and determine how they should interact with other agents or external systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Build Workflows\n",
    "With your agents in place, head to the **Workflows** section. Start by dragging and dropping skills, models, and agents onto the workflow canvas. Connect these components to form a logical sequence of operations. Add conditions, loops, and branches as needed to handle different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Test in the Playground\n",
    "Before deploying your workflow, test it in the **Playground** section. Run simulations to ensure everything functions as expected. Use this opportunity to fine-tune your setup, making any necessary adjustments to improve performance or accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Autogen Studio's intuitive interface and modular design make it easy to build and deploy sophisticated automation workflows. By following the structured process of defining skills, configuring models, designing agents, and constructing workflows, you can create powerful AI-driven solutions tailored to your specific needs. The Playground section offers a safe environment to test and refine your workflows, ensuring they are ready for real-world application.\n"
