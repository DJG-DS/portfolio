Watch Deployment 1 video and use HSBC JAM 1 folder first for basic deployment we did within Peak's tenancy. This is a proof of concept and to be used as educational. Once complete,
move on to Deployment 2 video with corresponding folder (HSBC JAM 2).

Deployment 2 video and HSBC JAM 2 folder contain information on deployment within the restricted tenancy of HSBC. This is accomplished by registering the Hugging Face base model from
local files, instead of calling the Hugging Face hub. It follows a similar approach to the first video, except for some additional parts. One such part is training the model using Azure's
'job' feature, which gives more control over the training, allowing the user to view the model trainings metrics and parameters. The notebook will include code for training the model as a 
job, as well as how to register the model from the job, but more time is needed for deploying the model from the job.
